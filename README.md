# NOTE
There's a newer Mainsail and Klipper branch that this has not been updated for. If you wish to use the latest, you'll need to do a manual install until I'm able to update the script.

# mainsail-installer
This is an install script to automate the [Klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper), [Klipper API](https://github.com/Arksine/klipper/tree/work-web_server-20200131), and [Web Interface](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail) installation process on Raspbian.  

Please read [How to Install](https://github.com/ArmyAg08/mainsail-installer#how-to-install) to get started.  

# What does this installer do?  
The installer will give you the option to configure several common items from running `sudo raspi-config`: change password, change hostname, and configure timezone. Hostname and timezone do impact how the Web UI displays information.

You will be prompted to download a sample Voron config from Github for your printer\'s model if you don\'t already have a config. There is a sparse config as a backup to allow the Web UI to start.  

The installer will install Klipper, the Klipper API, and the Web Interface.  

The installer will automatically compile the MCU firmware for the controller you select. It will not attempt to flash the MCU. You can find the output firmware file at `~/klipper/out/klipper.bin`.  

The installer will provide the option to setup mjpg-streamer if you want to use a webcam. If selected, it will also configure the Web UI to display the camera feed.  

# How to Install
**Note:** You should backup your `printer.cfg` before running the installer. Please also consider installing on a clean SD card in case you choose to return to Octoprint or encounter installer issues.  

Flash an SD card with the Raspbian Lite image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).  
Create a file named `ssh` (with no file extension) on the /boot partition to enable SSH.  
Create a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` on the /boot partition and add the contents to configure wireless access.  
Place your `printer.cfg`on the /boot partition and the installer will move it to the home directory.

Sample `wpa_supplicant.conf` contents look like this:  

    country=US
    update_config=1
    ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

    network={
     scan_ssid=1
     ssid="<YOUR_WIRELESS_SSID>"
     psk="<YOUR_WIRELESS_PASSWORD>"
    }  

Boot and SSH into your pi. Default credentials are pi/raspberry.  

Run the following commands as the user you use to work with to download and launch the installer:  

    wget -q -O mainsail-install.zip https://github.com/ArmyAg08/mainsail-installer/archive/master.zip && unzip -j -d ~/mainsail-installer/ mainsail-install.zip && rm mainsail-install.zip
    chmod +x ~/mainsail-installer/mainsail-install.sh
    ~/mainsail-installer/mainsail-install.sh
	
**IMPORTANT:** Please read all of the prompts carefully. There are many different configuration options to set and choose from.  

# Known Issues
* There are not currently any default configs for V0 or V1. Wget will fail in these instances.  

# To Do List
* Add MCU flashing  
* Add V0 and V1 printer.cfg links when available  
* Add SKR Mini E3 `make menuconfig` support  

Thanks to tinpec for cleaning up the first pass of my ASCII art and Fulg for bypassing the manual `make menuconfig` in klipper and a few of the other Voron devs for helping me hack my way through this :)
